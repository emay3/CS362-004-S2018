* SMITHY 
* Action: +3 cards
* Cost: 4 
*"+X Card(s)" â€“ the player immediately draws X number of cards from his
Deck. If there are not enough cards in his Deck, he draws as many as he
can, shuffles the Discard pile to form a new Deck, and then draws the
rest. If he still does not have enough cards left after forming a new Deck,
he just draws as many as he can.
